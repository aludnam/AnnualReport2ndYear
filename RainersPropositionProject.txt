 Improving on the automation (shutters, ...)
- Incorporating the sCMOS camera
- Implementing holographic (Hamamatsu SLM) control for local illumination
- Implementing near TIRF-illumination (Highly inclined illumination)
with small activation in Big depletion beam.
- Setting up a new superstable stage (Objective clamp)
- Taking superfantastic data
- Helping Ivana Sumanovac and Katrin Klees with finding optimal
embedding conditions and switching dyes
- Trying EOS-FP and mIrisFP for STORM
- Using QDots for Pointillistic imaging1
