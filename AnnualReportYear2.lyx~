\begin_layout Subsection
Localization microscopy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Localisation microscopy (LM) provides a conceptually simple way to super-resolut
ion microscopy as a single source can be localised with an uncertainity
 much smaller then a classical Rayeigh's resolution criterion.
 The Rayleigh's resolution criterion is a distance two sources must be separated
 in order to be able to resolve them as two individual objects.
 This is approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{em}/2$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{em}$
\end_inset

 is an emmission wavelength of the source 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Rayleigh1896,Born1975principles"

\end_inset

.
 However, the Rayleigh criterion neglects the stochastic nature of the photon-de
tection process and does not take the total photon count (intensity of the
 source) into account.
 As shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Thompson2002,Ram2006"

\end_inset

 the variance of a single source localisation is inversly proportional to
 the number of photons we can collect from this source.
 For sufficiently intense sources the localisation precision can significanlty
 surpass the Rayleigh resolution limit 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gordon2004,Qu2004,Lidke2005,Ober2004"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
PALM, STORM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the real biological samples the sources are usually highly overlapping
 and can't be individually localised.
 PALM (Photo Activation Localization Mcroscopy) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hess2006"

\end_inset

 and STORM (STochastic Optical Resolution Microscopy) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bates2007"

\end_inset

 are separating the individual sources by activating only a small subset
 of all sources.
 If the activated subset is smal enought the individual fluorophores are
 well spatially separated and can be locaized as individual sources.
 This requires an active control of the sources activation.
 It can be achieved either by using photo-activable (PA) fluorophores (PALM,
 STORM) or by reversive photo - bleaching 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Baddeley2009"

\end_inset

.
 Repetitition of this activation - localization cycles can provide high
 resolution microscopy images of biological samples 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Shroff2008,Huang2008"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Separation of individual emitters with overlapping PSFs from the statistical
 analysis of the recording of their blinking behaviour can also significantly
 speed the acquisition procedure (scaling inversely with the number of molecules
 localised per bright spot 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Small2009"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Quantum dots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quantum dots (QD) represent fluorophores that are an order of magnitude
 brighter and several orders of magnitude more photo-bleaching resistant
 compared to the organic dyes used in LM 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Jaiswal2004,Michalet2005"

\end_inset

.
 QDs also provide a wide absorbtion and a narrow excitation spectrum band.
 All these properties makes them very attractive for the biological research.
 Under a continuous excitation QDs exhibit a blinking behaviour (fluorescence
 intermittancy).
 They switch between “ON” episodes (
\begin_inset Formula $1/\tau_{\mathrm{ON}}^{m}$
\end_inset

) of a rapid absorption-fluorescence cycling and “OFF” episodes (
\begin_inset Formula $1/\tau_{\mathrm{OFF}}^{m}$
\end_inset

) where no light is emitted despite the continuous excitation.
 Both ON-time and OFF-time probability densities follow an inverse power
 law 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\tau_{\mathrm{ON/OFF}})\propto1/\tau_{\mathrm{ON/OFF}}^{m}$
\end_inset

 however, the blinking process is not yet fully understood 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kuno2001,Stefani2009"

\end_inset

.
 Despite all the advantages the QD provide, they are not suitable for the
 standard LM methods (PALM/STORM) as the QD blinking behavior is difficult
 to controle.
 The overlapping sources can't be then separated and subsequently localized
 individually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Localization microscopy using Quantum Dots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2005 there has been published a method exploiting the fluorescence intermitte
ncy ('blinking') of quantum dots under continuous excitation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lidke2005"

\end_inset

.
 A time series of the blinking quantum dots was recorded and analysed using
 Independent Component Analysis (ICA).
 FastICA algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hyvarinen2000"

\end_inset

 has been used.
 As the blinking of the individual quantum dot is independent with respect
 to blinking of other quantum dots individual emitters even with overlapping
 PSFs can be separated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Localisation of two quantum dots separated down to 23 nm (corresponding
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{\mathrm{em}}/30$
\end_inset

) has been reported 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 different configuration of the experiment can be found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Bayesian approach to the blinking of the individual fluorophores has been
 presented in poster in 2008 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 A localisation of several quantum dots within the diffracted limited volume
 has been shown.

\begin_layout Standard
A method using the quantum dots for measurement of sub-resolution distances
 has been published in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 However, discrete ON-OFF blinking is required (only one source being ON
 and others OFF) as opposed to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lidke2005,Harrington2008"

\end_inset

 where only fluctuation of the individual sources is needed.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) seems to be a very natural method
 for dealing with the blinking QD data.
 The expectation value of noisy spatio-temporal 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times T$
\end_inset

 data matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 - total number of pixels, 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 - number of time slices) is assumed to be decomposed into the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times K$
\end_inset

 spatial component matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 (images of the individual sources) and the 
\begin_inset Formula $K\times T$
\end_inset

 temporal component matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 (intensities of the sources).
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}\left[D\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[d_{xt}\right]=\left(WH\right)_{xt}=\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{xk}h_{kt}\label{eq:NMF model}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with non-negativity constraints 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{xt},\, w_{xk}\ \text{and}\ h_{kt}\geq0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The NMF algoright shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 minimizes the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between the data and the
 model.
 It can be shown that this is eqvivalent to the maximization log-likelihood
 function of the model Eq
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 under the assumtion of the Poisson noise (Appendix

 The details of the the algorithm are described in the first year review.

\begin_layout Section
Model comparison problem
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NMF requires a prior knowledge about the number of components to be separated
 (estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 - rank of the factorzation).
 For noise-free data it is possible to estimate the number of sources by
 analyxing principal components (PC), for example.
 However, in the noisy case the rank estimation is difficult.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard NMF algorithm maximizes the likelihood of the model Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 under the assumption of the Poisson noise corrupted data.
 The likelihood function increases with higher 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

.
 The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is a rough approximation of the
 Bayesian treatment penalysing the complexity of the model.
 By evaluating the model for different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 we can compare the BIC score.
 However, as shown in the first year review the BIC might be too crude approxima
tion for the correct estimation of the data dimensionality.

 A variational treatment of the problem (section

\begin_inset Formula $K$

 in the QD data.

and the log-likelihood
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

where the discrete latent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}$
\end_inset

 gives the intensity of the

 The distribution of the undelying GaP model now becomes

 estimation is to analyze the

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for different number of

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{xt}=\frac{d_{xt}-\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{xk}h_{kt}}{\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{xk}h_{kt}}

 correlation matrix 
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

Uderestimation of the number of sources (
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 too small) will lead to correlations between some pixels the model will
 try to explain the multiple sources by one object.
 By increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 the correlations should be gradually decrease until we have sufficient
 number of sources to explain the data and the residuals become uncorrelated.

 For this dataset it is easy to estimate the

 However when the density of the points becomes higher the 'kink' is much
 less pronounced (Fig.

 This suggest that for dense data sets there is not enough evidence in the
 data for the correct estimation of the

 as the data can be sufficiently explained with less complicated model (less
 sources are explaining data equally well).
 Its probably worth ephesizing that GaP model does not make any assumption

Results from the variational approximation naturally bring a question about
 actual limts of the LM metod.
 How close the sources can be in order to be possible to resolve them.
 The Rayleigh's resolution criterion neglects the stochastic nature of the
 photon-detection process and does not take the total photon count (intensity
 of the source) into account.
 As shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 the variance of a single source localisation is inversly proportional to
 the number of photons we can collect from this source.
 For sufficiently intense sources the localisation precision can significanlty
 surpass the Rayleigh resolution limit

 The sources intensities matrix can be highly correlated along the time

\begin_layout Standard
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have 
\begin_inset Formula $p(c_{k}|l_{k})=\mathrm{Po}(c_{k};l_{k})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(v_{jk}|c_{k})=\mathrm{Binom}(v_{jk};\theta_{jk},c_{k})=\binom{c_{k}}{v_{jk}}\theta_{jk}^{v_{jk}}(1-\theta_{jk})^{c_{k}-v_{jk}}$
\end_inset

 (probability of having 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{jk}$
\end_inset

 counts in 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}$

 Then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{2}
p(v_{jk}|l_{k}) & =\sum_{c_{k}}p(v_{jk}|c_{k})p(c_{k}|l_{k})\\
 & =\sum_{c_{k}=v_{jk}}^{\infty}\frac{c_{k}!}{v_{jk}!(c_{k}-v_{jk})!}\theta_{jk}^{v_{jk}}(1-\theta_{jk})^{c_{k}-v_{jk}}\times\frac{l_{k}^{c_{k}}\exp(-l_{k})}{c_{k}!}\\
 & =\frac{\exp(-l_{k})\theta_{jk}^{v_{jk}}}{v_{jk}!}\sum_{c_{k}=v_{jk}}^{\infty}\frac{l_{k}^{c_{k}}(1-\theta_{jk})^{c_{k}-v_{jk}}}{(c_{k}-v_{jk})!} & |\alpha_{jk}=c_{k}-v_{jk}\\
 & =\frac{\exp(-l_{k})(\theta_{jk}l_{k})^{v_{jk}}}{v_{jk}!}\sum_{\alpha_{jk}=0}^{\infty}\frac{(l_{k}-\theta_{jk}l_{k})^{\alpha_{jk}}}{(\alpha_{jk})!}\\

 & =\frac{(\theta_{jk}l_{k})^{v_{jk}}\exp(-\theta_{jk}l_{k})}{v_{jk}!}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and so 
\begin_inset Formula $p(v_{jk}|l_{k})\sim\mathrm{Po}(v_{jk};\theta_{jk}l_{k})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now sum of two independent Poisson distributed variables 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=X_{1}+X_{2}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
p(Z) & =\sum_{x_{1}=0}^{z}p(X_{1})p(Z-X_{1})\\
 & =\sum_{x_{1}=0}^{z}\frac{\lambda_{1}^{x_{1}}e^{-\lambda_{1}}}{x_{1}!}\frac{\lambda_{2}^{z-x_{1}}e^{-\lambda_{2}}}{(z-x_{1})!}\\
 & =\frac{e^{-(\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2})}}{z!}\sum_{x_{1}=0}^{z}\frac{z!}{x_{1}!(z-x_{1})!}\lambda_{1}^{x_{1}}\lambda_{2}^{z-x_{1}}\\
 & =\frac{(\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2})^{z}e^{-(\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2})}}{z!}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

for more by induction.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $w_{j}$
\end_inset

 is derived from 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 so it is not represented.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to integrate out 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 (not sure about discrete values...?):
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
p(V|\alpha,\beta,\theta,K) & =\int_{0}^{\infty}p(V,l|\alpha,\beta,\theta,K)dl\\

\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{2}
