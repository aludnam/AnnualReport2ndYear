\begin_layout Subsection
Localisation microscopy 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Localisation microscopy (LM) provides a conceptually simple way to super-resolut
ion microscopy as a single source can be localised with an uncertainty much
 smaller then a classical Rayeigh's resolution criterion (approximately
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{em}/2$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{em}$
\end_inset

 is an emission wavelength of the source 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Rayleigh1896,Born1975principles"

\end_inset

).
 The Rayleigh criterion neglects the stochastic nature of the photon-detection
 process and does not take the total photon count (intensity of the source)
 into account.
 As shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Thompson2002,Ram2006"

\end_inset

 the variance of a single source localisation is inversely proportional
 to the number of photons we can collect from this source.
 For sufficiently intense sources the localisation precision can significantly
 surpass the Rayleigh resolution limit 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Gordon2004,Qu2004,Lidke2005,Ober2004"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
PALM, STORM
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:PALM,-STORM"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the real biological samples the sources are usually dense and highly
 overlapping making the localisation of the individual sources very difficult.
 PALM (Photo Activation Localisation Microscopy) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hess2006"

\end_inset

 and STORM (STochastic Optical Resolution Microscopy) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bates2007"

\end_inset

 separate the individual emitters by activating only a small subset of them
 at a time.
 If the activated subset is small enough the individual fluorophores are
 well spatially dispersed and the individual sources can be identified and
 localised.
 This requires a control of the sources activation/excitation.
 It can be achieved either by using photo-activable (PA) fluorophores (PALM,
 STORM) or by reversive photo - bleaching 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Baddeley2009"

\end_inset

.
 Repetition of this activation - localisation cycles can provide super-resolutio
n images of biological samples

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Quantum dots
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Quantum-dots"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quantum dots (QD) are an order of magnitude brighter and several orders
 of magnitude more photo-bleaching resistant fluorophores compared to the
 organic dyes used in LM 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Jaiswal2004,Michalet2005"

\end_inset

.
 QDs also provide a wide absorption and a narrow excitation spectrum which
 is very convenient for multicolour imaging.
 All these properties make QD very attractive for biological research.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under a continuous excitation QDs exhibit a blinking behaviour (fluorescence
 intermittency).
 They switch between “ON” episodes (
\begin_inset Formula $1/\tau_{\mathrm{ON}}^{m}$
\end_inset

) of a rapid absorption-fluorescence cycling and “OFF” episodes (
\begin_inset Formula $1/\tau_{\mathrm{OFF}}^{m}$
\end_inset

) where no light is emitted despite the continuous excitation.
 Both ON-time and OFF-time probability densities follow an inverse power
 law 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\tau_{\mathrm{ON/OFF}})\propto1/\tau_{\mathrm{ON/OFF}}^{m}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kuno2001,Stefani2009"

\end_inset

.
 However, the blinking process is not yet fully understood .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite all the advantages the QD can potentially provide, they are not
 suitable for the standard LM methods (PALM/STORM).
 The QD blinking behaviour is difficult to control and the overlapping sources
 cannot be separated and localised individually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Localisation microscopy using Quantum Dots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2005 there has been published a method exploiting the fluorescence intermitte
ncy ('blinking') of QDs under continuous excitation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lidke2005"

\end_inset

.
 A time series of the blinking QDs was recorded and analysed using Independent
 Component Analysis (ICA); FastICA algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hyvarinen2000"

\end_inset

 has been used.
 Localisation of two quantum dots separated down to 23 nm (corresponding
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{\mathrm{em}}/30$
\end_inset

) has been reported 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lidke2005"

\end_inset

.
 Further exploration of the technique for more than two sources and for
 different configuration of the experiment can be found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lidke2007"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Bayesian approach to the blinking QD data has been presented 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Harrington2008"

\end_inset

.
 A model consisting of PSFs with known shape (all sources are assumed to
 have PSF of the same form) and individual intensities (normally distributed)
 was fitted to the data.
 Localisation of several QDs within the diffracted limited volume has been
 shown.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A method using QDs for measurement of sub-resolution distances has been
 published in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lagerholm2006"

\end_inset

.
 However, discrete ON-OFF blinking is required (only one source being ON
 and others OFF) as opposed to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lidke2005,Harrington2008"

\end_inset

 where only fluctuation of the individual sources is needed.

\begin_layout Subsection
Non-negative matrix factorisation
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) seems to be a very natural model
 for describing the blinking QD data.
 The expectation value of noisy spatio-temporal

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $N\times K$
\end_inset

 spatial component matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{W}$
\end_inset

 (images of the individual sources) and the

An observed `blurred' (diffraction limited) image 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{i}$

\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $\bm{o}$
\end_inset

) is the original (unblurred) object which represents locations and intensities
 of fluorescent sources.

 and Lucy 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 published an iterative deconvolution technique for astronomical images
 with known PSF.
 They used Bayes theorem as a `hint' for an iterative update of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{o}$
\end_inset

.
 This update is usually referred to as Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution
 algorithm and is identical to the Lee-Seung NMF update with generalised
 KL-divergence objective function 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lee2001"

\end_inset

.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{o}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{w}$
\end_inset

 represent different objects then the matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{W}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{H}$
\end_inset

 in the NMF model.
 In the RL deconvolution one PSF 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{w}$
\end_inset

 is shared by all sources.
 In the NMF each source has its own PSF (columns of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{W}$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align block
Holmes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Holmes:92"

\end_inset

 derived the RL updates based on maximum likelihood estimation of the model
 with Poisson noise using the expectation-maximisation algorithm.
 He also proposed an update for 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{w}$
\end_inset

 so that the method can be used as a blind deconvolution algorithm (PSF
 is not known).
 They are sometimes referred to as a `blind RL algorithm'.
 The updates for 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{o}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{w}$
\end_inset

 are technically identical to the Lee and Seung NMF updates (KL divergence
 as an objective function).
 Modified updates imposing radial symmetry constraints on PSF were also
 proposed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align block
There exist several modified updates derived using EM algorithm which impose
 some constraints on 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{o}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{w}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Joshi:93"

\end_inset

 gives updates where Good's roughness measure (
\begin_inset Formula $\int\frac{\left|\nabla f(x)\right|^{2}}{f(x)}dx$
\end_inset

) on the original image 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{o}$
\end_inset

 is used as a regularisation term.
 This biases the solution towards the `smooth' images and avoids speckle
 artefacts in the reconstructions that are sometimes experienced in deconvolutio
n methods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align block
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Fish:95"

\end_inset

 use RL `blind' algorithm (updates on both 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{o}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{w}$
\end_inset

) but after some number of iterations they fit some approximation of the
 PSF to the estimated 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{w}$
\end_inset

 and uses this fit as a new 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{w}$
\end_inset

.
 They claim that in noisy images this `semi-blind' deconvolution can perform
 better than the one with known PSF.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The comparison of the regularised RL versions and some other deconvolution
 techniques has been shown in

\begin_layout Standard
NMF requires a prior knowledge about the number of components to be separated
 (
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 in Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:NMF model"

\end_inset

 - rank of the factorisation).
 For noise-free data it is possible to estimate the number of sources by
 analysing principal components (PC), for example.
 However, in the noisy case the estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is difficult.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard NMF algorithm maximises the likelihood of the model Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 under the assumption of the Poisson noise corrupted data (Appendix
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Appendix NMF-as-minimization"

\end_inset

).
 The likelihood function increases with higher 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 as the more flexible model fits the data better.
 The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is a rough approximation of the
 Bayesian treatment penalising the complexity of the model.
 By evaluating the model for different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 we can compare the BIC score.
 However, as shown in the first year review the BIC might be too crude approxima
tion for the correct estimation of the data dimensionality.

 The `

 The matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{xk}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{kt}$
\end_inset

 were initialised at random from uniform distribution.
 The columns of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 were normalised such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{x}w_{xk}=1$
\end_inset

 and the columns of the matrix

\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{x,k}w_{xk}h_{kt}=\sum_{k}h_{kt}=\sum_{x}d_{xt}$

 This heuristic procedure helps to reach better local minimum (discussed

 We can observe some increase of the residual correlations after NMF updates
 with `true' initialisation.
 These correlations are higher then in the results evaluated with random
 initialisation.
 This might suggest that, for example, the highly overlapping sources can
 be more efficiently explained by one source and the remaining components
 used for some minor correction in the model.

 In order to investigate what is the `resolution' of this

 times as a different draws from a Poisson distribution (with identical

\begin_layout Standard
The variational lower bound provides correct estimates only for relatively
 easy data (Fig.

\min_{W,H\geq0}KL(D\Vert WH)=\min_{W,H\geq0}-\sum_{xt}\left(d_{xt}\log\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{xk}h_{kt}-\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{xk}h_{kt}\right)+C\label{eq:Appendix KL(D|WH)}\end{equation}

).
 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset
>>>>>>> 2e83b208dfa5db10865f171a4cebee8d43613352

 is systematically underestimated for the data with higher densities of
 the sources (Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Histogram:Variational-lower-bound"

\end_inset

).
 This is intuitive as several highly overlapping sources corrupted with
 noise can be approximated with one larger source.
 Comparison to the results evaluated after initialisation with the `true'
 values (matrices used for data simulation) suggests that the higher values
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $K<K_{true}$
\end_inset

 is due to the lack of evidence in the data rather then convergence to a
 `wrong' solution (Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:K estimation - pca,loglik,lowerboudn,correl"

\end_inset

k-l).
 The value of the lower bound for the `true' initialisation do not exceed
 the values for the model with 
\begin_inset Formula $K<K_{true}$
\end_inset

.
 When the data do not provide enough evidence, the bayesian approach tend
 to prefer the less complicated model (underestimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The more accurate estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 were achieved by analysis of the correlations in the residuals (Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Histogram: Maximum-correlations-in"

\end_inset

), however, the 'kink' can be difficult to estimate for the dense data (Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:K estimation - pca,loglik,lowerboudn,correl"

\end_inset

i) and a visual inspection of the curves is ofter required.
 Some automated procedure for the `kink' detection is needed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth emphasising that NMF nor GaP models do not make any assumptions
 about the time structure of the (latent) variables 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{kt}$
\end_inset

 This information might provide stronger evidence for the correct 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 estimation.

Results from the variational approximation naturally bring a question about
 actual limits of the LM method.
 How close the sources can be in order to be possible to resolve them with
 the LM method? What are the limiting factors? Does the fluorescence intermitten
cy (blinking) allow for higher resolution? We tried to address these question
 by examining the Cramér–Rao lower bound for the variance of the estimator
 on distance between two sources.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

A fundamental resolution measure (FREM) for two sources separated by a distance
 
\begin_inset Formula $d$

 The Fisher information is derived as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
I(d)=\frac{1}{4}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\left(\Lambda_{1}\int_{C_{n}}\partial_{x}q(x-\frac{d}{2})dx-\Lambda_{2}\int_{C_{n}}\partial_{x}q(x+\frac{d}{2})dx\right)^{2}}{\Lambda_{1}\int_{C_{n}}q(x-\frac{d}{2})dx+\Lambda_{2}\int_{C_{n}}q(x+\frac{d}{2})dx},\label{eq:Ram FREM}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the intensity of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th source, 
\begin_inset Formula $q(x)$
\end_inset

 is a response function of a source (
\begin_inset Formula $\int q(x)dx=1$
\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

 is an area of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

th pixel.
 The variance of the estimator on 
\begin_inset Formula $d$

 is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{var}(d)=I^{-1}(d).

\end_inset

A short summary is shown in Appendix
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Appendix Two-sources-separated"

\end_inset

.
 There are certain problems with this formula, though.
 The limit 
\begin_inset Formula $d\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 gives the Fisher information 
\begin_inset Formula $I(d)\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\text{var}(d)\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

) for situation when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{1}=\Lambda_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 However, the variance remains finite (
\begin_inset Formula $I(d)\neq0$
\end_inset

) when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{1}\neq\Lambda_{2}$
\end_inset

 (see discussion in Appendix
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Appendix Two-sources-separated"

\end_inset

).
 The formula also gives 
\begin_inset Formula $I(d)\neq0$
\end_inset

 even for the situation when one of the sources is not present (
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{i}=0$
\end_inset

).
 This stems from the fact that the response function of the sources are
 assumed to be located at 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm\frac{d}{2}$
\end_inset

 which implicitly assumes the knowledge of the origin location.
 Only one source is then needed to determined the distance

\begin_layout Subsection
FREM for blinking sources
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the fundamental questions is whether the fluorescence intermittency
 (QD blinking) allows for higher resolution compared to the situation when
 the sources remains static over time.
 To address this question we assume a simple model of Poisson distributed
 data with mean values 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}$
\end_inset

 shown in Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Mean value of hte Poisson process"

\end_inset

.
 We assume the intensity vector of the two sources 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{\Lambda}=(\Lambda_{1},\Lambda_{2})$
\end_inset

 to be a random variable distributed over four distinctive states 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ \bm{\Lambda}^{1}=(\Lambda_{1},0),\,\bm{\Lambda}^{2}=(0,\Lambda_{2}),\,\bm{\Lambda}^{3}=(\Lambda_{1},\Lambda_{2}),\,\bm{\Lambda}^{4}=(0,0)\right\} .
\]

\end_inset

This simulates a simple blinking model of two QDs.
 If the state of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{\Lambda}$
\end_inset

 were known we would write the likelihood function as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
l(\theta)=p(n,\bm{\Lambda}|\theta)=\prod_{p=1}^{N}p(n_{p}|\theta,\bm{\Lambda})p(\bm{\Lambda}),
\]

\end_inset

and the expected Fisher information matrix would become (Appendix

 The exact state in each situation is unknown.
 Therefore we have to integrate over

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
l(\theta)=\prod_{p=1}^{N}p(n_{p}|\theta)=\prod_{p=1}^{N}\sum_{i=1}^{4}p(n_{p},\bm{\Lambda}^{i}|\theta)=\prod_{p=1}^{N}\sum_{i=1}^{4}p(n_{p}|\theta,\bm{\Lambda}^{i})p(\bm{\Lambda}^{i}).\label{eq:FREM likelihood Lanbda integrated out}

 suggest that the in certain setting (bright sources low background) the
 blinking sources can significantly increase the localisation precision
 compared to the static situation.
 This effect is stronger for close (
\begin_inset Formula $d<50\ \text{nm}$
\end_inset

) and bright (
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda>1000\ \text{photons}$
\end_inset

) sources with lower background levels (
\begin_inset Formula $bg<100$
\end_inset

).
 This corresponds to a realistic setting for QD data (simulated data shown
 in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:effect of the background and illustration of the noisy sources with backgroud"

\end_inset

c).
 For well separated sources (
\begin_inset Formula $d\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 limit) the static situation provides lower bound for the localisation precision.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The regions where the blinking is preferable to the static case depends
 on the intensity of the sources (Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Comparison Fisher-informaton and variance"

\end_inset

a) as well as on the background levels (Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Comparison Fisher-informaton and variance"

\end_inset

b).
 Background have a large impact on the localisation precision as shown in
 Fig.

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:effect of the background and illustration of the noisy sources with backgroud"

\end_inset

 and it is desirable to keep is as low as possible.
 In practice a large proportion of the background intensity comes from the
 out of focus light.
 Typically TIRF (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent microscopy) illumination
 of the sources is used to reduce the out-of-focus blur.
 However, different techniques such as local illumination of the sample
 can be used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary the bright sources (high signal-to-noise ratio) are desirable
 for the LM techniques.
 In this setting the blinking can provide higher localisation precision
 for closely spaced sources.
 QDs can be an order of magnitude brighter then the organic fluorescent
 markers (section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Quantum-dots"

\end_inset

) and are promising candidates for LM.
 However, the Fisher Information approach gives a lower bound on the variance.
 The actual localisation precision for the blinking sources depend on the
 ability to separate the individual emitters.
 This can be challenging for closely spaced sources and the separation might
 be the actual limiting factor for the localisation precision.

The point spread function (PSF) is a rather complicated 3D object.
 A scan along the axial direction through a PSF of an optical microscope
 (Fig.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

) shows the characteristic ringings for out-of-focus PSF.
 In a real biological sample PSF from different focal planes can overlap.
 As the NMF does not make any assumption about the PSFs of the individual
 sources (parameter matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

), it is possible to separate overlapping QDs located in different axial
 positions.
 This can be possible used for the 3D localisation of the sources.
 Moreover the PSF of the individual sources can differ due to the aberrations
 caused by imperfections of the microscope or by inhomogenities of the refractiv
e index in the sample.
 However, the PSF of each source must remain constant during the data acquisitio
n.

As the NMF does not make any assumption about the shape of the sources it
 should be capable of separating the PSF distorted by various aberrations
 as well.
 In

, for example, the optical astigmatism is introduced in STORM data in order
 the PSF changes its elliptical shape for different axial positions.
 This allows for 3D localisation of the sources.
 NMF might separate the overlapping aberrated sources and allow this method
 to use QDs instead of the photo-activable organic fluorophores.

Standard NMF does not require any prior knowledge about the matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

, apart from the non-negativity constraints.
 We can use a permutation operator to the data for the indices along the
 space (
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{x}(x)$
\end_inset

) or the time (
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{t}(t)$
\end_inset

) dimension without changing the permuted factorised matrices
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V_{\pi_{x}(x)\pi_{t}(t)}=\sum_{k=1}^{K}W_{\pi_{x}(x)k}H_{k\pi_{t}(t)}
\]

\end_inset

However, there can be a rich information contained in the time-series nature
 of the data.
 The sources intensities matrix can be highly correlated along the time
 dimension - the sources that are ON at one time are likely to be ON in
 the following time instant.

) would benefit from easy access to the microscopic lab.
 Data presented in this review were acquired during the my visit of the
 Rainers lab in Jena in April 2011.
 Some of the data suffered from acquisition imperfection (drift of the sample).
 More carefully conducted experiments are therefore needed.
  Moreover I would like get more experience in an optical lab and direct
 the project towards experimental work.
 We have already discussed with Rainer the possibility of an extended visit
 (mid September - December 2011) of his lab in Jena.
 There are several smaller projects that could be done in such a time period
 (3-4 months).
 Here are some of the Rainers propositions out of which I would like to
 work on at least one:

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\emph default
Implementing of the sources separation method in QDs stained real biological
 samples.
 This would require determination of the suitable staining density of the
 samples.
 The images of real samples are desirable for publication in biologically
 oriented journals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

This allows for faster scanning of the sample and can result in high time
 resolution images and shorter acquisition time for scanning techniques
 (such as confocal microscopy).
 In addition it also reduces the level of the out-of-focus background intensity.
 As discussed in section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 this can lead to higher localisation precision for the LM techniques.

\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have 
\begin_inset Formula $p(c_{k}|l_{k})=\mathrm{Po}(c_{k};l_{k})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(v_{jk}|c_{k})=\mathrm{Binom}(v_{jk};\theta_{jk},c_{k})=\binom{c_{k}}{v_{jk}}\theta_{jk}^{v_{jk}}(1-\theta_{jk})^{c_{k}-v_{jk}}$
\end_inset

 (probability of having 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{jk}$
\end_inset

 counts in 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}$
\end_inset

 counts).
 Then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{2}
p(v_{jk}|l_{k}) & =\sum_{c_{k}}p(v_{jk}|c_{k})p(c_{k}|l_{k})\\
 & =\sum_{c_{k}=v_{jk}}^{\infty}\frac{c_{k}!}{v_{jk}!(c_{k}-v_{jk})!}\theta_{jk}^{v_{jk}}(1-\theta_{jk})^{c_{k}-v_{jk}}\times\frac{l_{k}^{c_{k}}\exp(-l_{k})}{c_{k}!}\\
 & =\frac{\exp(-l_{k})\theta_{jk}^{v_{jk}}}{v_{jk}!}\sum_{c_{k}=v_{jk}}^{\infty}\frac{l_{k}^{c_{k}}(1-\theta_{jk})^{c_{k}-v_{jk}}}{(c_{k}-v_{jk})!} & |\alpha_{jk}=c_{k}-v_{jk}\\
 & =\frac{\exp(-l_{k})(\theta_{jk}l_{k})^{v_{jk}}}{v_{jk}!}\sum_{\alpha_{jk}=0}^{\infty}\frac{(l_{k}-\theta_{jk}l_{k})^{\alpha_{jk}}}{(\alpha_{jk})!}\\
 & =\frac{\exp(-l_{k})(\theta_{jk}l_{k})^{v_{jk}}}{v_{jk}!}\exp(l_{k}-\theta_{jk}l_{k})\\
 & =\frac{(\theta_{jk}l_{k})^{v_{jk}}\exp(-\theta_{jk}l_{k})}{v_{jk}!}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and so 
\begin_inset Formula $p(v_{jk}|l_{k})\sim\mathrm{Po}(v_{jk};\theta_{jk}l_{k})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now sum of two independent Poisson distributed variables 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=X_{1}+X_{2}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}\sim\mathrm{\mathrm{Po}}(x;\lambda_{i})$
\end_inset

)is Poisson distributed:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
p(Z) & =\sum_{x_{1}=0}^{z}p(X_{1})p(Z-X_{1})\\
 & =\sum_{x_{1}=0}^{z}\frac{\lambda_{1}^{x_{1}}e^{-\lambda_{1}}}{x_{1}!}\frac{\lambda_{2}^{z-x_{1}}e^{-\lambda_{2}}}{(z-x_{1})!}\\
 & =\frac{e^{-(\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2})}}{z!}\sum_{x_{1}=0}^{z}\frac{z!}{x_{1}!(z-x_{1})!}\lambda_{1}^{x_{1}}\lambda_{2}^{z-x_{1}}\\
 & =\frac{(\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2})^{z}e^{-(\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2})}}{z!}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

for more by induction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{j}=\sum_{k=1}^{K}v_{jk}$
\end_inset

 is Poisson distributed:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w_{j}\sim\mathrm{Po}(w_{j};\sum_{k=1}^{K}\theta_{jk}l_{k})

\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The likelihood of GaP model with latent matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula

 & =\prod_{k}\mathrm{Gamma}(l_{k};\alpha_{k},\beta_{k})\prod_{jk}\mathrm{Po}(c_{k};l_{k})\times\mathrm{Multinom}(v_{jk};\theta_{jk},c_{k})
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
explicitly:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(V,l|\alpha,\beta,\theta,K)=\prod_{k}\frac{\beta_{k}^{\alpha_{k}}l_{k}^{c_{k}+\alpha_{k}-1}\exp(-(\beta_{k}+1)l_{k})}{\Gamma(\alpha_{k})}\prod_{jk}\frac{\theta_{jk}^{v_{jk}}}{v_{jk}!}\label{eq:likelihood V,l}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline}
\log p(V,l|\alpha,\beta,\theta,K)=\sum_{k}\left\{ (c_{k}+\alpha_{k}-1)\log l_{k}-(\beta_{k}+1)l_{k}+\alpha_{k}\log\beta_{k}-\log\Gamma(\alpha_{k})+\sum_{j}\left[v_{jk}\log\theta_{jk}-\log v_{jk}!\right]\right\} \label{eq:log-likelihood V,l}
\end{multline}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $w_{j}$
\end_inset

 is derived from 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 so it is not represented.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to integrate out 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 (not sure about discrete values...?):
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
p(V|\alpha,\beta,\theta,K) & =\int_{0}^{\infty}p(V,l|\alpha,\beta,\theta,K)dl\\
 & =\prod_{jk}\frac{\theta_{jk}^{v_{jk}}}{v_{jk}!}\prod_{k}\frac{\beta_{k}}{\Gamma(\alpha_{k})}\int_{0}^{\infty}\left[l_{k}^{c_{k}+\alpha_{k}-1}\exp(-(\beta_{k}+1)l_{k})\right]dl_{k}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{2}
\int_{0}^{\infty}\left[l_{k}^{c_{k}+\alpha_{k}-1}\exp(-(\beta_{k}+1)l_{k})\right]dl_{k} & =\int_{0}^{\infty}l_{k}^{z-1}\exp(-(\beta_{k}+1)l_{k})dl_{k} & |c_{k}+\alpha_{k}=z\\
 & =\frac{1}{\left(\beta_{k}+1\right)^{z}}\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{z-1}\exp(-t)dt & |(\beta_{k}+1)l_{k}=t\\
 & =\frac{1}{\left(\beta_{k}+1\right)^{z}}\Gamma(z)
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

so 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(V|\alpha,\beta,\theta,K)=\prod_{k}\frac{\beta_{k}}{\left(\beta_{k}+1\right)^{c_{k}+\alpha_{k}}}\frac{\Gamma(c_{k}+\alpha_{k})}{\Gamma(\alpha_{k})}\prod_{jk}\frac{\theta_{jk}^{v_{jk}}}{v_{jk}!}
