Introduction

\begin_layout Subsection
Localization microscopy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Localisation microscopy (LM) provides a conceptually simple way to super-resolut
ion microscopy as a single source can be localised with an uncertainity
 much smaller then a classical Rayeigh's resolution criterion.
 The Rayleigh's resolution criterion is a distance two sources must be separated
 in order to be able to resolve them as two individual objects.
 This is approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{em}/2$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{em}$
\end_inset

 is an emmission wavelength of the source 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Abbe1873,Born1975principles"

\end_inset

.
 However, the Rayleigh criterion neglects the stochastic nature of the photon-de
tection process and does not take the total photon count (intensity of the
 source) into account.
 As shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Thompson2002,Ram2006"

\end_inset

 the variance of a single source localisation is inversly proportional to
 the number of photons we can collect from this source.
 For sufficiently intense sources the localisation precision can significanlty
 surpass the Rayleigh resolution limit

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
PALM, STORM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the real biological samples the sources are usually highly overlapping
 and can't be individually localised.
 PALM (Photo Activation Localization Mcroscopy) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hess2006"

\end_inset

 and STORM (STochastic Optical Resolution Microscopy) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bates2007"

\end_inset

 are separating the individual sources by activating only a small subset
 of all sources.
 If the activated subset is smal enought the individual sources are well
 separated and they can be locaized.
 This requires an active control of the sources activation.
 It can be achieved either by using photo-activable (PA) fluorophores (PALM,
 STORM) or by reversive photo - bleaching 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Baddeley2009"

\end_inset

.
 Repetitition of this activation - localization cycles can provide high
 resolution microscopy images of biological samples

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Quantum dots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quantum dots (QD) represent fluorophores that are an order of magnitude
 brighter and several orders of magnitude more photo-bleaching resistant
 compared to the organic dyes used in LM 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Jaiswal2004,Michalet2005"

\end_inset

.
 QDs also provide a wide absorbtion and a narrow excitation spectrum band.
 All these properties makes them very attractive for the biological research.
 Under a continuous excitation QDs exhibit a blinking behaviour (fluorescence
 intermittancy).
 They switch between “ON” episodes (
\begin_inset Formula $1/\tau_{\mathrm{ON}}^{m}$
\end_inset

) of a rapid absorption-fluorescence cycling and “OFF” episodes (
\begin_inset Formula $1/\tau_{\mathrm{OFF}}^{m}$
\end_inset

) where no light is emitted despite the continuous excitation.
 Both ON-time and OFF-time probability densities follow an inverse power
 law 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\tau_{\mathrm{ON/OFF}})\propto1/\tau_{\mathrm{ON/OFF}}^{m}$
\end_inset

 however, the blinking process is not yet fully understood 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kuno2001,Stefani2009"

\end_inset

.
 Despite all the advantages the QD provide, they are not suitable for the
 standard LM methods (PALM/STORM) as the QD blinking behavior is difficult
 to controle.
 The overlapping sources can't be then separated and subsequently localized
 individually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Localization microscopy using Quantum Dots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2005 there has been published a method exploiting the fluorescence intermitte
ncy ('blinking') of quantum dots under continuous excitation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lidke2005"

\end_inset

.
 A time series of the blinking quantum dots was recorded and analysed using
 Independent Component Analysis (ICA).
 FastICA algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hyvarinen2000"

\end_inset

 has been used.
 As the blinking of the individual quantum dot is independent with respect
 to blinking of other quantum dots individual emitters even with overlapping
 PSFs can be separated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Localisation of two quantum dots separated down to 23 nm (corresponding
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{\mathrm{em}}/30$
\end_inset

) has been reported 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lidke2005"

\end_inset

.
 Further exploration of the technique for more than two sources and for
 different configuration of the experiment can be found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lidke2007"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Bayesian approach to the blinking of the individual fluorophores has been
 presented in poster in 2008 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Harrington2008"

\end_inset

.
 A localisation of several quantum dots within the diffracted limited volume
 has been shown.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A method using the quantum dots for measurement of sub-resolution distances
 has been published in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lagerholm2006"

\end_inset

.
 However, discrete ON-OFF blinking is required (only one source being ON
 and others OFF) as opposed to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lidke2005,Harrington2008"

\end_inset

 where only fluctuation of the individual sources is required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Separation of individual emitters with overlapping PSFs from the statistical
 analysis of the recording of their blinking behaviour can also significantly
 speed the acquisition procedure (scaling inversely with the number of molecules
 localised per bright spot
