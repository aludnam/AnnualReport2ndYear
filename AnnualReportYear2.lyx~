\begin_layout Subsection
Localisation microscopy 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Localisation microscopy (LM) provides a conceptually simple way to super-resolut
ion microscopy as a single source can be localised with an uncertainty much
 smaller then a classical Rayeigh's resolution criterion (approximately
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{em}/2$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{em}$
\end_inset

 is an emission wavelength of the source 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Rayleigh1896,Born1975principles"

\end_inset

).
 The Rayleigh criterion neglects the stochastic nature of the photon-detection
 process and does not take the total photon count (intensity of the source)
 into account.
 As shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Thompson2002,Ram2006"

\end_inset

 the variance of a single source localisation is inversely proportional
 to the number of photons we can collect from this source.
 For sufficiently intense sources the localisation precision can significantly
 surpass the Rayleigh resolution limit

PALM, STORM
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:PALM,-STORM"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the real biological samples the sources are usually dense and highly
 overlapping making the localisation of the individual sources very difficult.
 PALM (Photo Activation Localisation Microscopy) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hess2006"

\end_inset

 and STORM (STochastic Optical Resolution Microscopy) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bates2007"

\end_inset

 separate the individual emitters by activating only a small subset of them
 at a time.
 If the activated subset is small enough the individual fluorophores are
 well spatially dispersed and the individual sources can be identified and
 localised.
 This requires a control of the sources activation/excitation.
 It can be achieved either by using photo-activable (PA) fluorophores (PALM,
 STORM) or by reversive photo - bleaching 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Baddeley2009"

\end_inset

.
 Repetition of this activation - localisation cycles can provide super-resolutio
n images of biological samples

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Quantum dots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quantum dots (QD) are an order of magnitude brighter and several orders
 of magnitude more photo-bleaching resistant fluorophores compared to the
 organic dyes used in LM 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Jaiswal2004,Michalet2005"

\end_inset

.
 QDs also provide a wide absorption and a narrow excitation spectrum which
 is very convenient for multicolour imaging.
 All these properties make QD very attractive for biological research.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under a continuous excitation QDs exhibit a blinking behaviour (fluorescence
 intermittency).
 They switch between “ON” episodes (
\begin_inset Formula $1/\tau_{\mathrm{ON}}^{m}$
\end_inset

) of a rapid absorption-fluorescence cycling and “OFF” episodes (
\begin_inset Formula $1/\tau_{\mathrm{OFF}}^{m}$
\end_inset

) where no light is emitted despite the continuous excitation.
 Both ON-time and OFF-time probability densities follow an inverse power
 law 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\tau_{\mathrm{ON/OFF}})\propto1/\tau_{\mathrm{ON/OFF}}^{m}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kuno2001,Stefani2009"

\end_inset

.
 However, the blinking process is not yet fully understood .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite all the advantages the QD can potentially provide, they are not
 suitable for the standard LM methods (PALM/STORM).
 The QD blinking behaviour is difficult to control and the overlapping sources
 cannot be separated and localised individually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Localisation microscopy using Quantum Dots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2005 there has been published a method exploiting the fluorescence intermitte
ncy ('blinking') of QDs under continuous excitation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lidke2005"

\end_inset

.
 A time series of the blinking QDs was recorded and analysed using Independent
 Component Analysis (ICA); FastICA algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hyvarinen2000"

\end_inset

 has been used.
 Localisation of two quantum dots separated down to 23 nm (corresponding
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{\mathrm{em}}/30$
\end_inset

) has been reported 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lidke2005"

\end_inset

.
 Further exploration of the technique for more than two sources and for
 different configuration of the experiment can be found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Bayesian approach to the blinking QD data has been presented in poster
 in 2008 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Harrington2008"

\end_inset

.
 A model consisting of PSFs with known shape (all sources are assumed to
 have PSF of the same form) and individual intensities (normally distributed)
 was fitted to the data.
 Localisation of several QDs within the diffracted limited volume has been
 shown.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A method using QDs for measurement of sub-resolution distances has been
 published in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lagerholm2006"

\end_inset

.
 However, discrete ON-OFF blinking is required (only one source being ON
 and others OFF) as opposed to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lidke2005,Harrington2008"

\end_inset

 where only fluctuation of the individual sources is needed.

Non-negative matrix factorisation
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) seems to be a very natural model
 for describing the blinking QD data.
 The expectation value of noisy spatio-temporal 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times T$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\bm{D}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 - total number of pixels, 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 - number of time slices) is assumed to be decomposed into the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times K$
\end_inset

 spatial component matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{W}$
\end_inset

 (images of the individual sources) and the 
\begin_inset Formula $K\times T$
\end_inset

 temporal component matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{H}$
\end_inset

 (intensities of the sources).
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}\left[\bm{D}\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[d_{xt}\right]=\left(\bm{WH}\right)_{xt}=\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{xk}h_{kt},\label{eq:NMF model}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with non-negativity constraints 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{xt},\, w_{xk}\ \text{and}\ h_{kt}\geq0$

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The NMF algorithm shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 minimises the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between the data and the
 model.
 It can be shown that this is equivalent to the maximisation log-likelihood
 function of the model Eq

 and Lucy 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 published an iterative deconvolution technique for astronomical images
 with known PSF.
 They used Bayes theorem as a `hint' for an iterative update of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{o}$
\end_inset

.
 This update is usually referred to as Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution
 algorithm and is identical to the Lee-Seung NMF update with generalised
 KL-divergence objective function 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lee2001"

\end_inset

.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{o}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{w}$
\end_inset

 represent different objects then the matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{W}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{H}$
\end_inset

 in the NMF model.
 In the RL deconvolution one PSF 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{w}$
\end_inset

 is shared by all sources.
 In the NMF each source has its own PSF (columns of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{W}$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Holmes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Holmes:92"

\end_inset

 derived the RL updates based on maximum likelihood estimation of the model
 with Poisson noise using the expectation-maximisation algorithm.
 He also proposed an update for 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{w}$
\end_inset

 so that the method can be used as a blind deconvolution algorithm (PSF
 is not known).
 They are sometimes referred to as a `blind RL algorithm'.
 The updates for 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{o}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{w}$
\end_inset

 are technically identical to the Lee and Seung NMF updates (KL divergence
 as an objective function).
 Modified updates imposing radial symmetry constraints on PSF were also
 proposed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align block
There exist several modified updates derived using EM algorithm which impose
 some constraints on 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{o}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{w}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 gives updates where Good's roughness measure (
\begin_inset Formula $\int\frac{\left|\nabla f(x)\right|^{2}}{f(x)}dx$
\end_inset

) on the original image 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{o}$
\end_inset

 is used as a regularisation term.
 This biases the solution towards the `smooth' images and avoids speckle
 artefacts in the reconstructions that are sometimes experienced in deconvolutio
n methods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

 use RL `blind' algorithm (updates on both 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{o}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{w}$
\end_inset

) but after some number of iterations they fit some approximation of the
 PSF to the estimated 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{w}$
\end_inset

 and uses this fit as a new 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{w}$
\end_inset

.
 They claim that in noisy images this `semi-blind' deconvolution can perform
 better than the one with known PSF.

\begin_layout Standard
NMF requires a prior knowledge about the number of components to be separated
 (
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 in Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:NMF model"

\end_inset

 - rank of the factorisation).
 For noise-free data it is possible to estimate the number of sources by
 analysing principal components (PC), for example.
 However, in the noisy case the estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is difficult.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard NMF algorithm maximises the likelihood of the model Eq.

 under the assumption of the Poisson noise corrupted data (Appendix
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Appendix NMF-as-minimization"

\end_inset

).
 The likelihood function increases with higher 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 as the more flexible model fits the data better.
 The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is a rough approximation of the
 Bayesian treatment penalising the complexity of the model.
 By evaluating the model for different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 we can compare the BIC score.
 However, as shown in the first year review the BIC might be too crude approxima
tion for the correct estimation of the data dimensionality.

 as

 Then pick the model with

This should be contrasted with the maximul-likelihood approach (such as
 NMF) where 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{kt}$
\end_inset

 (and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{xk}$
\end_inset

) are treated as parameters of the model and the likelihood of the model
 is maximized with respect to these parameters.
 The more complex models with higher

A different approach to estimating the number of components 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is to analyse the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times T$
\end_inset

 residual matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{S}$
\end_inset

 (entries 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{xt}$
\end_inset

).
 After optimising the parameters of the model Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:NMF model"

\end_inset

 for different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

, we compute a normalised residual matrix 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{xt}=\frac{d_{xt}-\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{xk}h_{kt}}{\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{xk}h_{kt}}}.
\]

\end_inset

The normalisation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{xk}h_{kt}\right)^{-1/2}$
\end_inset

 is applied in order to standardise the residuals of Poisson distributed
 data (
\begin_inset Formula $\text{var}(x)=\text{mean}(x)$
\end_inset

).
 We can then compute the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times N$
\end_inset

 correlation matrix 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bm{C}_{S}=\bm{SS}^{T},
\]

\end_inset

and the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times N$
\end_inset

 matrix of the correlation coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $ $
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\bm{R}_{S}$

\begin_layout Standard
Underestimation of the number of sources (

 too small) will lead to correlations between some pixels as the model will
 try to explain multiple sources by one object.
 By increasing

 the correlations should are expected to decrease until we reach a sufficient
 number of sources to explain the data and the residuals become uncorrelated.

From the results presented above it seems that the analysis of the residual
 correlations gives the most precise 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 estimation for high densities of sources.
 In order to investigate what is the `resolution' of this 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 estimation we simulated datasets consisitng of 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{true}=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{true}=5$
\end_inset

.
 The sources were distributed uniformly on a circle with diameter 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 Each data set was simulated 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

 times as a different draws from a Poisson distribution (with identical
 parameters).
 Each dataset was evaluated with NMF for 
\begin_inset Formula $K=\{K_{true}-1,\, K_{true},\, K_{true}+1\}$
\end_inset

.
 The maximum correlations coefficients in residuals 
\begin_inset Formula $\max_{ij}(r_{ij})$
\end_inset

 has been recorded.
 The mean (and standard deviation) and the minimum values over 
\begin_inset Formula $10$

 are shown in Fig.

 the correlations drop significantly to a baseline level.

Results from the variational approximation naturally bring a question about
 actual limits of the LM method.
 How close the sources can be in order to be possible to resolve them with
 the LM method? What are the limiting factors? Does the fluorescence intermitten
cy (blinking) allow for higher resolution? We tried to address these question
 by examining the Cramér–Rao lower bound for the variance of the estimator
 on distance between two sources.

A fundamental resolution measure (FREM) for two sources separated by a distance
 
\begin_inset Formula $d$

 the photon statistics on the detector (CCD camera).
 The Fisher information is derived as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
I(d)=\frac{1}{4}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\left(\Lambda_{1}\int_{C_{n}}\partial_{x}q(x-\frac{d}{2})dx-\Lambda_{2}\int_{C_{n}}\partial_{x}q(x+\frac{d}{2})dx\right)^{2}}{\Lambda_{1}\int_{C_{n}}q(x-\frac{d}{2})dx+\Lambda_{2}\int_{C_{n}}q(x+\frac{d}{2})dx},\label{eq:Ram FREM}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the intensity of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th source, 
\begin_inset Formula $q(x)$
\end_inset

 is a response function of a source (

\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

 is an area of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

th pixel.
 The variance of the estimator on 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{var}(d)=I^{-1}(d).

\end_inset

A short summary is shown in Appendix
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 There are certain problems with this formula, though.
 The limit 
\begin_inset Formula $d\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 gives the Fisher information 
\begin_inset Formula $I(d)\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\text{var}(d)\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

) for situation when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{1}=\Lambda_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 However, the variance remains finite (
\begin_inset Formula $I(d)\neq0$
\end_inset

) when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{1}\neq\Lambda_{2}$
\end_inset

 (see discussion in Appendix
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Appendix Two-sources-separated"

\end_inset

).
 The formula also gives 
\begin_inset Formula $I(d)\neq0$
\end_inset

 even for the situation when one of the sources is not present (
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{i}=0$
\end_inset

).
 This stems from the fact that the response function of the sources are
 assumed to be located at 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm\frac{d}{2}$
\end_inset

 which implicitly assumes the knowledge of the origin location.
 Only one source is then needed to determined the distance

FREM for blinking sources
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the fundamental questions is whether the fluorescence intermittency
 (QD blinking) allows for higher resolution compared to the situation when
 the sources remains static over time.
 To address this question we assume a simple model of Poisson distributed
 data with mean values 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}$
\end_inset

 shown in Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Mean value of hte Poisson process"

\end_inset

.
 We assume the intensity vector of the two sources 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{\Lambda}=(\Lambda_{1},\Lambda_{2})$
\end_inset

 to be a random variable distributed over four distinctive states 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ \bm{\Lambda}^{1}=(\Lambda_{1},0),\,\bm{\Lambda}^{2}=(0,\Lambda_{2}),\,\bm{\Lambda}^{3}=(\Lambda_{1},\Lambda_{2}),\,\bm{\Lambda}^{4}=(0,0)\right\} .
\]

\end_inset

This simulates a simple blinking model of two QDs.
 If the state of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{\Lambda}$
\end_inset

 were known we would write the likelihood function as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
l(\theta)=p(n,\bm{\Lambda}|\theta)=\prod_{p=1}^{N}p(n_{p}|\theta,\bm{\Lambda})p(\bm{\Lambda}),
\]

\end_inset

and the expected Fisher information matrix would become (Appendix

 The exact state in each situation is unknown.
 Therefore we have to integrate over

\end_inset

 and the likelihood function is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
l(\theta)=\prod_{p=1}^{N}p(n_{p}|\theta)=\prod_{p=1}^{N}\sum_{i=1}^{4}p(n_{p},\bm{\Lambda}^{i}|\theta)=\prod_{p=1}^{N}\sum_{i=1}^{4}p(n_{p}|\theta,\bm{\Lambda}^{i})p(\bm{\Lambda}^{i}).\label{eq:FREM likelihood Lanbda integrated out}

 Results presented in the Fig.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 suggest that the intensity blinking of the sources can increase the localisatio
n precision for the situations when the sources are very close.
 However, for well separated sources (
\begin_inset Formula $d\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 limit) the static situation provide upper bound for the entries of the
 Fisher information matrix of blinking model (Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:variance d static vs blinking"

\end_inset

).
 In this configuration the static situation allows for more precise localisation.
 The intersection points of the curves for static and blinking model depends
 on the intensity of the sources (Fig.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 More investigation will be needed to explore the effect of the background.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) shows the characteristic ringings for out-of-focus PSF.
 In a real biological sample PSF from different focal planes can overlap.
 As the NMF does not make any assumption about the PSFs of the individual
 sources (parameter matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

), it is possible to separate overlapping QDs located in different axial
 positions.
 This can be possible used for the 3D localisation of the sources.
 Moreover the PSF of the individual sources can differ due to the aberrations
 caused by imperfections of the microscope or by inhomogenities of the refractiv
e index in the sample.
 However, the PSF of each source must remain constant during the data acquisitio
n.

Conclusion and Future work 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We demonstrated the capability of NMF to separate individual highly overlapping
 sources with different PSFs (Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Out of focus QD - Separated-sources"

\end_inset

).
 The estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 (number of sources in data) remains a difficult task for realistic data
 sets.
 The variational lower bound (section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Variational-treatment-of"

\end_inset

) provides correct estimates only for relatively easy data (Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:simulations 2.5 delta "

\end_inset

).
 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is severely underestimated for the data with higher densities of the sources
 (Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:K estimation - pca,loglik,lowerboudn,correl"

\end_inset

).
 The most accurate estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 were achieved by analysis of the correlations in the residuals (Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:K estimation - pca,loglik,lowerboudn,correl"

\end_inset

).
 The `resolution' of this method for two and five sources is shown in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Correlations-in-residuals."

\end_inset

.
 The use of information about the time structure of the data would certainly
 help in this task.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Blinking behaviour of the sources has been theoretically demonstrated to
 allow for higher localisation precision (Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:variance d"

\end_inset

) especially for brighter sources.
 Further analysis is required to examine the effect of the background in
 the data to provide more realistic description of the resolution limit.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Standard NMF does not require any prior knowledge about the matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

, apart from the non-negativity constraints.
 We can use a permutation operator to the data for the indices along the
 time (
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{x}(x)$
\end_inset

) or the space (
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{t}(t)$
\end_inset

) dimension without changing the permuted factorised matrices
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V_{\pi_{x}(x)\pi_{t}(t)}=\sum_{k=1}^{K}W_{\pi_{x}(x)k}H_{k\pi_{t}(t)}
\]

\end_inset

However, there can be a rich information contained in the time-series nature
 of the data.
 The sources intensities matrix can be highly correlated along the time
 dimension - the sources that are ON at one time are likely to be ON in
 the following time instant.

\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have 
\begin_inset Formula $p(c_{k}|l_{k})=\mathrm{Po}(c_{k};l_{k})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(v_{jk}|c_{k})=\mathrm{Binom}(v_{jk};\theta_{jk},c_{k})=\binom{c_{k}}{v_{jk}}\theta_{jk}^{v_{jk}}(1-\theta_{jk})^{c_{k}-v_{jk}}$
\end_inset

 (probability of having 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{jk}$
\end_inset

 counts in 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}$
\end_inset

 counts).
 Then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{2}
p(v_{jk}|l_{k}) & =\sum_{c_{k}}p(v_{jk}|c_{k})p(c_{k}|l_{k})\\
 & =\sum_{c_{k}=v_{jk}}^{\infty}\frac{c_{k}!}{v_{jk}!(c_{k}-v_{jk})!}\theta_{jk}^{v_{jk}}(1-\theta_{jk})^{c_{k}-v_{jk}}\times\frac{l_{k}^{c_{k}}\exp(-l_{k})}{c_{k}!}\\
 & =\frac{\exp(-l_{k})\theta_{jk}^{v_{jk}}}{v_{jk}!}\sum_{c_{k}=v_{jk}}^{\infty}\frac{l_{k}^{c_{k}}(1-\theta_{jk})^{c_{k}-v_{jk}}}{(c_{k}-v_{jk})!} & |\alpha_{jk}=c_{k}-v_{jk}\\
 & =\frac{\exp(-l_{k})(\theta_{jk}l_{k})^{v_{jk}}}{v_{jk}!}\sum_{\alpha_{jk}=0}^{\infty}\frac{(l_{k}-\theta_{jk}l_{k})^{\alpha_{jk}}}{(\alpha_{jk})!}\\
 & =\frac{\exp(-l_{k})(\theta_{jk}l_{k})^{v_{jk}}}{v_{jk}!}\exp(l_{k}-\theta_{jk}l_{k})\\
 & =\frac{(\theta_{jk}l_{k})^{v_{jk}}\exp(-\theta_{jk}l_{k})}{v_{jk}!}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and so 
\begin_inset Formula $p(v_{jk}|l_{k})\sim\mathrm{Po}(v_{jk};\theta_{jk}l_{k})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now sum of two independent Poisson distributed variables 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=X_{1}+X_{2}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}\sim\mathrm{\mathrm{Po}}(x;\lambda_{i})$
\end_inset

)is Poisson distributed:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
p(Z) & =\sum_{x_{1}=0}^{z}p(X_{1})p(Z-X_{1})\\
 & =\sum_{x_{1}=0}^{z}\frac{\lambda_{1}^{x_{1}}e^{-\lambda_{1}}}{x_{1}!}\frac{\lambda_{2}^{z-x_{1}}e^{-\lambda_{2}}}{(z-x_{1})!}\\
 & =\frac{e^{-(\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2})}}{z!}\sum_{x_{1}=0}^{z}\frac{z!}{x_{1}!(z-x_{1})!}\lambda_{1}^{x_{1}}\lambda_{2}^{z-x_{1}}\\
 & =\frac{(\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2})^{z}e^{-(\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2})}}{z!}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

for more by induction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{j}=\sum_{k=1}^{K}v_{jk}$
\end_inset

 is Poisson distributed:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w_{j}\sim\mathrm{Po}(w_{j};\sum_{k=1}^{K}\theta_{jk}l_{k})
\]

 & =e^{-l_{k}\sum_{j}\theta_{jk}}l_{k}^{\sum_{j}v_{jk}}\prod_{j}\frac{\theta{}^{v_{jk}}}{v_{jk}!} & |\sum_{j}\theta_{jk}=1,\sum_{j}v_{jk}=c_{k}\\
 & =\frac{l_{k}^{c_{k}}e^{-l_{k}}}{c_{k}!}c_{k}!\prod_{j}\frac{\theta{}^{v_{jk}}}{v_{jk}!}\\
 & =\mathrm{Po}(c_{k};l_{k})\times\mathrm{Multinom}(v_{jk};\theta_{jk},c_{k})
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The likelihood of GaP model with latent matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $V$

\begin_inset Formula

 & =\prod_{k}\mathrm{Gamma}(l_{k};\alpha_{k},\beta_{k})\prod_{jk}\mathrm{Po}(c_{k};l_{k})\times\mathrm{Multinom}(v_{jk};\theta_{jk},c_{k})
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
explicitly:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(V,l|\alpha,\beta,\theta,K)=\prod_{k}\frac{\beta_{k}^{\alpha_{k}}l_{k}^{c_{k}+\alpha_{k}-1}\exp(-(\beta_{k}+1)l_{k})}{\Gamma(\alpha_{k})}\prod_{jk}\frac{\theta_{jk}^{v_{jk}}}{v_{jk}!}\label{eq:likelihood V,l}

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\end{multline}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $w_{j}$
\end_inset

 is derived from 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 so it is not represented.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to integrate out 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 (not sure about discrete values...?):
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
p(V|\alpha,\beta,\theta,K) & =\int_{0}^{\infty}p(V,l|\alpha,\beta,\theta,K)dl\\
 & =\prod_{jk}\frac{\theta_{jk}^{v_{jk}}}{v_{jk}!}\prod_{k}\frac{\beta_{k}}{\Gamma(\alpha_{k})}\int_{0}^{\infty}\left[l_{k}^{c_{k}+\alpha_{k}-1}\exp(-(\beta_{k}+1)l_{k})\right]dl_{k}
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{2}
\int_{0}^{\infty}\left[l_{k}^{c_{k}+\alpha_{k}-1}\exp(-(\beta_{k}+1)l_{k})\right]dl_{k} & =\int_{0}^{\infty}l_{k}^{z-1}\exp(-(\beta_{k}+1)l_{k})dl_{k} & |c_{k}+\alpha_{k}=z\\
 & =\frac{1}{\left(\beta_{k}+1\right)^{z}}\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{z-1}\exp(-t)dt & |(\beta_{k}+1)l_{k}=t\\
 & =\frac{1}{\left(\beta_{k}+1\right)^{z}}\Gamma(z)

\end_inset

so 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

 of the static case.
 The factor of 2 stems from the fact that the total number of photons is
 double in the static case compared to the blinking model.
